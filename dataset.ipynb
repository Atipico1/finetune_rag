Compiled and remastered by Mark Ayres, the album features mostly sound effects and atmospheres from the first six years of the programme. Although some incidental music tracks do appear, most of the album's content is by original Doctor Who sound effects creator Brian Hodgson. The compilation also features three Radiophonic Workshop realisations of early Doctor Who composer Dudley Simpson's work. The compilation was the first release of Radiophonic Workshop material following the department's closure and was intended by archiver Ayres to be the beginning of a series covering the varied output of the department. The series was to have included material from other children's programmes such as Roger Limb's score from The Box of Delights as well as music from documentaries and radio, although only material related to Doctor Who has so far been released.\",\n",

With 66 trails, 1,200 acres (4.9 km2) and 2,047 feet (624 m) vertical, Solitude is one of the smaller ski resorts near Salt Lake City, along with its neighbor Brighton. It is a family-oriented mountain, with a wider range of beginner and intermediate slopes than other nearby ski resorts; 70% of its slopes are graded \"beginner\" or \"intermediate,\" the highest such ratio in the Salt Lake City area. Solitude was one of the first major US resorts to adopt an RFID lift ticket system, allowing lift lines to move more efficiently while reducing \"lift poaching\". It was followed by Alta Ski Area in 2007. Solitude is adjacent to Brighton Ski Resort near the top of Big Cottonwood Canyon. Solitude and Brighton offer a common \"Solbright Pass\" which provides access to both resorts for a nominal surcharge.',\n",

The magical realist style and thematic substance of One Hundred Years of Solitude established it as an important, representative novel of the literary Latin American Boom of the 1960s and 1970s, which was stylistically influenced by Modernism (European and North American) and the Cuban Vanguardia (Avant-Garde) literary movement. One Hundred Years of Solitude was first published in Spanish in 1967; it has been translated into thirty-seven languages and has sold more than 30 million copies. The novel remains widely acclaimed, and is considered García Márquez's masterpiece.\",\n",
